    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>My name is Brandon Jean-Pierre and I am a third-year Information Technology student at Kennesaw State University.I was born in Atlanta and raised in Roswell, GA. I have always been intrested in Technology and how it shapes the world around us. This intrest has led to explore the differents of IT, eventually leading me toward the cybersecurity route. I plan to develop my skills in order for me to protect digital environments from evolvings and further my career after college.
        My academic journey has been filled with my hands-on experiences, such as network analysis through WireShark and SQL database management through Microsoft SQL Server management Studio. </p>

        <h2> My Experiences</h2>
        <p> Outside of academics, I balance my studies with work at Publix, where I am a Part-time cashier. My responsibilites are to collect carts from outside, assist customers with checking them out at the register, and making sure that every customer is respected and well taken care of.
            These roles have strengthened my work ethic and taught me the value of patience and customer service. This job has made me able to handle certain situations where I can assess what to do.
        </p>
        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p> My goals for the future is to secure an IT internship to gain work experience in IT and help build a foundation for my future career in cybersecurity. I am also working towards earning my CompTIA A+ certification to solidify my technical knowledge.
            I also want to potentially get offered a full time position from an internship when I graduate as it will be a major stepping stone for my career. With a growing skill set and determination, I am excited for the opportunities that lie ahead on my path.
