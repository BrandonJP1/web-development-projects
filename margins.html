    <p>CSS is a W3C standard for describing the appearance of HTML
        elements.
        • With CSS, we can assign font properties, colors, sizes, borders,
        background images, positioning and even animate elements on
        the page.
        • CSS can be added directly to any HTML element (via the style
        attribute), within the <head> element, or, most commonly, in a
        separate text file that contains only CSS.
